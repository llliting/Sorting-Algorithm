# Sorting-Algorithm

Collaborate with [Liting Huang](https://github.com/llliting).  

Sorting-Algorithm implements most of common used comparison sorts and linear sorts with some slight adujusment. It also provides a sample test case to show the actual running time of the sorting algorithm.

**To run the sample test, type in:**
```
$ go to tools folder
$ make all
$ go back 
$ make all
$ ./sorting.exe
```
**Sorting Algorithms:**
* bubble sort
* recursive bubble sort
* bubble sort(inline assembly code)(NOT DONE YET)
* selection sort
* insertion sort
* recursive insertion sort
* merge sort
* merge sort with insertion sort in merge proceduce*
* merge sort with selection sort in merge proceduce*
* heap sort
* quick sort
* randomized quick sort (three median method)*
* counting sort
* radix sort 
* bucket sort  

\*The implementations are based closely on the Introduction To Algorithms implementation described by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.

**Future Work:**
* datasetGeneator.py:
* make the size of data changeable.

* interactive.py:
* Prompt the user to selete sorting algorithms
* Make some tables and graphs:
1) Matplotlib, numpy, and other python packages (on A-N)
2) Gnuplot (on Terminal)
* Generate a running report in Excel
